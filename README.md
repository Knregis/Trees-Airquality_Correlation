As a final project we were given the task of creating a question we would like to research. There are plenty of trees of different species that can found all throughout New York. Due to NYC Park's initiative to plant trees along the sidewalks of each bourough, I had to wonder if the increase in trees made a positive correlation with the air quality. Therefore, I wanted to dedicate an exploratory data analysis project towards this topic.

## Data

---

The three datasets used were taken from NYC's Open Data:

* [airquality](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r/about_data)
* [tree_2005](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2005-Street-Tree-Census/29bw-z7pj/about_data)
* [tree_2015](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh/about_data)

#### Data Cleaning

    to tailor the data to my research question I cleaned the data to remove duplicates, blank rows,

## Results

---

There is not a linear relationship between both datasets, so the null hypothesis was not rejected.

## Conclusion

---

The null hypothesis could not be rejected from the tests and distributions of values. Before
concluding that trees do not have a positive correlation with air quality, I believed the sun
provided nutrients to plants but also contributed to human well-being, so trees receive support
from the environment and assist other lifeforms. The lack of correlation between the three
datasets makes me question if the amount of variables I had in my datasets was enough to reach a
fruitful conclusion. If I redo this project, I would make my hypothesis explore how the number
of trees affects the air quality and the health of NYC's population
