AITA for being in love with my best friend?,"Im a YA who has lived with my two best friends since the day this small town we live in was built. The neighbors know us as the BFFs and weve always been super close. Lets just call me S.

My roommate Travis fell in love with this woman, Hannah, and moved out to be with her. After he left, he invited me to the wedding as their one witness. After seeing him standing at the end of the aisle, I realized I was in love with him and clearly he must love me too since I was the only guest at the wedding.

I confessed my feelings to him, even asked him to woohoo with me in a bush, and he rejected me and told me I was out of line. But I think its important he knows all of his options and that Im here when hes ready.

He then shut me out of his life completely! Without Travis, I was forced to lure Hannahs ex Don Lothario to my house and give him a makeover to look like Travis. Don says that its really creepy and I shouldnt have done that.

Now, Don is in my basement and Ive been learning magic and even set Hannah on fire once. It wasnt successful but Travis still says Im crazy and need to stay away from them.

Don says he doesnt want to be in my basement anymore either as my own personal Travis doll. I told him that wasnt an option.

I love Travis and want to be with him any way I can. AITA for wanting to be with my one true love, even if its Don dressed as him until I can convince Travis to be mine, and eventually get rid of Don once that happens?",0.99,6693,0,6693,1732815827.0,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.987}",Positive

Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

Guys! I think I found a life hack for mental health via this game! ,"I was feeling really down about myself and just overall shitty, so I altered my SimSelf with what I believe to be my worst traits.

My traits were lazy, erratic, and loner. I take more naps now, relax more, talk to myself in the mirror in nice ways, and purposely avoid social interaction for at least 1 entire day per week. Oddly enough, relieving these traits of their wants has allowed my other traits to be more helpful and motivational. I play my flute, paint, read, cook, meditate, and play with my cats more often.

Left the sims 4 running fully autonomously for 3 days here's what happened.,"Had to use a few mods, the mods did the following. Auto pay bills, auto make popup choices, make them more self sufficient, make them have kids on their own, and make the sims repair objects on their own. 

The sims ALL had conflicting personalities and there were 6 of them (to leave room for children).

Hour one
I build a small 8 bed house, 4 bunks per room and large communal spaces and get them all jobs and let the game take over


Hour 3 
To my horror Art Woman, the materialistic gloomy artist, ends up on a relationship with Fix Woman, the Neat genius industrious. This means two of our 3 potential parents are fully off the table but that's OK because we still have Evil woman the evil mean spirited glutton. 

Things go well and evil woman seems to be taking a liking to WooHoo Man, the Self Absorbed Loyal Romantic.

10 hours
Tragedy strikes as Evil Woman gets stuck after work standing in the driveway. She eventually starves to death waiting to go to work. Woohoo man died 6 hours later of extreme sadness, he kept mourning her grave in the front yard. 

11 hours
It was at this point the worst possible thing happens, Neat Woman is trying to cook something and sets the house on fire. Seeing as how the kitchen was in the basement for budget reasons she burns to death before the firemen can extinguish the fire. Fixit woman is depressed but manages to survive and a moment of hope shines that somebody might have a child. 

Life reaches a kind of uneasy stasis as things are being fixed, cleaned and the sims are staying mostly happy and fed. 

Hour 27
Fixit woman has began to build a romantic relationship with Slob Man, a slobbish bro snob, however before they're able to produce any children Lazy Man, a lazy good art lover pees himself in front of the mini-fridge. As Neat Woman is dead nobody prioritizes the mess and Fixit Woman decided it was more important to repair the broken mini-fridge. She is electrocuted by Lazy Man's urine and dies on the spot. 

Here's where things get weird. Fixit woman was the weak link. 
Although children can't be had now, Lazy Man and Slob Man achieved apotheosis. For the next FOURTY FIVE HOURS they develop a GOD TIER strategy for survival. 

They both REFUSE to fix anything and the house instantly goes to shambles. Everything is broken and all plumbing is busted.

They wake up, upset, pee on the floor and go to work hungry, they then EAT AT WORK and come home. By this time they're both in the orange mood and severely upset. Slob Man comes home to a filthy house and thinks ""Home Swwet Home!"" And his mood goes back up to green. Lazy Man comes home, has a good cry in the driveway then walks inside and sits in the comfy chair and makes unbreaking eye contact with a painting for the rest of the night. This gives him a buff from the chair, from Lazy, and from art lover. 


They then repeat this cycle, occasionally having work friends over (who visibly get sad when they enter the house) or talking to each other until they reach the Elder state and die of old age nearly starving to death but somewhat happy.

I wish new Sims didnt have to actually be brand new to life.,"I know Im far from the first person to point this out, but I hate how new Sims have no ability to have a backstory that is reflected in gameplay. I would love to be able to program Sims in CAS to reflect a past. Like when I make Elder Sims, I want them to retired from a successful career; and instead, I get unemployed sims whose greatest achievement is being an average high school student. Id also love to be able to record a divorce without actually having to get divorced in the game. Especially the older the Sim is, the more it makes sense that they would have had more past relationships and experiences. I do like that you can create dead Sims now, because I use this feature a lot to create widows and widowers in CAS. 

Since younger Sims are allowed to develop skills in gameplay, it feels like you should get a certain number of skill points to assign to adult sims in CAS. (Im pretty sure you were able to do this in Sims2.) Am I really supposed to believe that my young adult Sim whose greatest aspiration in life is to become a chef has never cooked before? She waited until she was 18 years old to make a grilled cheese sandwich? I realize you can easily cheat to increase skill points, but its somewhat tedious and I find that it sometimes randomly just doesnt work. Its annoying that my super fit, workout obsessed Sim who owns a gym franchise has to get mentoring from a teenage Sim to gain skill faster, because for whatever reason, the cheat code just doesnt work in his game. A gym mogul whos a level 3 in fitness? Embarrassing lol. 

One thing I always laugh at is when two married sims who have multiple children together woo hoo in my game for the first time and it gets recorded as their first time ever woohooing.

It would also be fun to encounter NPCs who are randomly assigned back stories, even if they had to keep it a little more simplified. A cheerful vampire Sim who wants to find a soulmate? Kind of boring. A cheerful vampire Sim who was an overachiever in high school and has been divorced three times is looking for a soulmate? Far more intriguing.

Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2353,0,2353,1683184874.0,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9432}",Positive

I HATE when my Sims have specific interests,"I know you guys know what I mean? The most common one is when they are obsessed with the family computer, right? There are many others I hate and want to rant about!

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I cant find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and dont even drink them! Sometimes I dont even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and theres about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I dont even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - its fine in the summer but in the winter? When its snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

"Which sim, a literal blob of pixels, do YOU personally have beef with?","Ill go first. Lou Howell. 

I was so excited when I saw him in game, my sim married him and everything. Then he continuously cheated on his partner as they were literally giving birth to their child. He stole so much shit from the hospital he almost missed the birth from getting scolded. He simply REFUSED to take care of his kids, and then had the nerve to deny they were his when my sim came after him for child support. 

Then, in a TOTALLY different save, my brand new LEGACY save, he starts acting up again. I, like a total moron, let my sim have full autonomy when I start playing to see who they go after. Well, she finds him at a bar and they hook up in the bathroom ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE GAMEPLAY and she gets pregnant. He makes my life a living nightmare by constantly coming over to just eat my food and rampage to destroy my house. I hate him. I want him GONE.

"Storyline Ideas  that have kept things interesting, especially in my legacy files!","1. With the new skill mentoring options, every single teen / young adult / adult / elder comes over after school if my sim is working or building their skills so a cousin, auntie, or grandma can give an after-school violin or piano or logic lesson. The schedule changes whether or not theyre involved in after-school activities, &amp; the lesson will be over by dinner but it is so good for building relationships &amp; skills simultaneously 

2. Especially after they introduced horses, i always have a farm within the family with horses for any kids growing up in the suburbs to take lessons. Whether the equestrian lessons are after school for a few days or they just move in with Grandma for the summer, its great for them to eventually compete &amp; win without having to have the horses live on their property, &amp; its cute to take the trophies back to their room after the summer. Its like the movie Flicka where the mom chose a different life but the kids still go back to the farm 

3. Although its annoying, try to utilize holidays as much as possible, ESPECIALLY SUMMER / WINTER / FALL BREAKS. You dont even have to do traditions, you can just check off that theres no school or work. Its relieving to have vacation time without needing to take the vacation

4. With as many skilled sims as possible, try to challenge yourself to fill the gaps in each career, especially the doctor career. When your sim arrives at the hospital in labor, &amp; you have family members that are at different levels (i.e. nurse, receptionist, medical tech, doctor, surgeon, chief of staff) they may be staffed at the hospital when you have the baby. Also, the labor mod really gives you an immersive at-home option where having a doctor in the family makes it a special moment

5. Make a rescue vet clinic with low prices to compete with an upscale vet clinic, that way if down the line your sim needs to save money they have options

6. BB.ENABLEFREEBUILD
Make sure you get functional gallery replacements for the hospital, police station, etc but especially the high school. I personally revamped my gallery edit &amp; found the perfect way to utilize essentially every skill. Now, the high school has:
Basketball court inside w bleachers &amp; soccer field outside, outdoor food stalls with city recipe kiosks &amp; picnic areas, a full yoga room next to a separate full-sized cheer room, a big gym that everyone can use in the morning or EOD, a separate boy / girl lounge with coffee, entertainment etc &amp; photo booths, arcade games &amp; karaoke machine outside of the gym &amp; yoga area, a coffee / computer cafe separate from the lunchroom, a full debate stage with chairs for the audience, a police station for the sneaky lick trends, separate boy &amp; girl locker rooms with showers, art, science, computer labs separate from the classrooms that lessons take place, as well as separate admin offices like athletics, guidance counselors, &amp; the main office w the principal.

7. Separate Boy / Girl Uniforms for school everyday outfits to insinuate your toddlers are in montessori, &amp; kids &amp; teens are in private school, if you have different grades they can have different corresponding uniforms especially for specific colors (there are many cc creators that make private school uniforms)

8. In order to have a successful save, try to keep the generations alive to keep elders busy. Invite them over for stay overs to raise the kids non-stop, the growing together pack really changed elders

9. to differentiate age groups, have your oldest elders live in a retirement home (for rent needed) &amp; give them clubs (get together) with activities like knitting or walking around San sequoia (growing together). Have them be differentiated from your younger elders that live in the suburbs by giving them more wrinkles or glasses or head scarves, &amp; shorter thinner whiter hair

10. Open a RETAIL STORE w one of your fresh chef sims &amp; make all of the city recipes so any of your sims can buy them &amp; learn them on the spot. If you have dine out, you can do this with the experimental dishes as well, you just need the chefs station from that pack to make them after you learn the recipe from ordering it at an experimental restaurant. Especially if you have a legacy save, its great to have sims you no longer use take over retail stores like this to keep it in business &amp; not lose all of the recipes over &amp; over again

11. A huge part of my legacy file has been ingratiating my innocent lineage with mafia figures in the criminal career &amp; having the children of these resulting marriages either marry rival mafia figures &amp; start their own lineage, or leave the life altogether &amp; stop talking to the family members that are still connected. Its interesting thru the years to see, for example, in 3 generations to see a successful criminal have multiple kids, the son inherits the business &amp; gets help from his parents to raise the next mafia figures, while the daughter leaves altogether for a simpler life in the countryside &amp; subsequently receives 0 support or visits from her criminally-connected family members, even during the worst financial constraints. Having different cousins &amp; uncles in politics, law &amp; order, law enforcement, etc makes things extra interesting when everyone is aligning each others pockets

12. Have struggling young families run small businesses like flower shops, wedding dress stores, or just utilize the idea of a walkable commercial space especially office buildings. Have a business park campus for important meetings or club gatherings

13. Make clubs for group gatherings like PTA moms, single dads, cheer squad (cheer practice can be everyday after school w that option) &amp; make complicated social dynamic rules for each club, even if its a homeless group of teens that eats at bars &amp; showers in gyms, the possibilities are endless

But our guests enjoyed mingling amongst themselves. Judith Ward even showed Bob Ross and Stuart Little her favorite recipe: microwaved smelly plate air. 

But then the worst thing happened. Bob Ross heard Reddits cries and somehow broke out. He evaporated into the ether, only to reappear and take out the trash. It was bizarre. But it proves hes happy at R U Not Entertainedment! Though there was another scare where I thought his painting was a cry for help. Turns out it was just a recreation of an alien abduction. See, hes totally fine!! 

And as an act of kindness, Bert hired Geoffrey Landgraab. Geoffrey would hangout and clean up the place after Malcolms death, so he might as well get (fake) payment for it.

However now she is left aimless. The old lady who took her in valued education and so she feels she has to pursue higher education (university) in the old lady's memory. However she was so absorbed in her studies she has no friends and no real passions.

I was terrified of it for a long time, but I finally bought it on the last sale and. Its fine? 

The romantic satisfaction system decays quickly, yes. But my 5th gen couple was compatible and never dipped below fine. All I had to do to keep them at satisfied or very satisfied was flirt a few times once a day. They dont even need to woo-hoo. 

I can see how this is annoying for people who like to set it and forget it but I actually like enjoy having to work to maintain the relationship now. 

Hell, Im actively trying to get my 6th Gen heirs wife to break up with him for the drama, and theyre both very satisfied even though she finds him unattractive. 

Custom dates change my gameplay for the better. I also really love all the new romantic interactions, and the CAS and BB items.

"Interior Decorator was a good idea, executed by a mad-man who hates the world.","Okay, on the surface, the Interior Decorator job is really cool.

You take gigs to go visit people's houses and businesses.  You interview them, see what they like, and get to play build mode for fun and profit.  Sounds good, right?

Sweet Sim Jeebus, no, it isn't.

If you don't find your gig employer before the gig starts and manually set their likes to be decent, the game assigns RANDOM likes to them.  So next thing you know, you're talking to the client about redoing their bar, and they're telling you ""You will fail this gig and everyone will hate you if you don't decorate in hot pink and neon green, and it all has to be in the theme of patio furniture.""

Now, I'm not going to say the Sims team puts in a ton of effort to make the best default builds anyone has ever seen, but holy crap are even the WORST dev builds better than 90% of what the Interior Decorator requirements force you to make for people.

Spellcasters make the best parents ,"Transportalate and scruberoo make raising kids a breeze. My sim's baby just had a blowout all over her, usually a nightmare as they freak out about being dirty, refusing to clean up the poor baby. She just scrubaroo'd herself and she's happy as a clam! I did just learn she can't scruberoo the baby tho. But it's also amazing for toddlers, she has finished the entire skill tree, so she can cast a spell from across their huge house to clean a potty chair before he gets to it. Messy eater quirk? Np, SCRUBEROO! And if your spellcaster isn't leveled up, those kids will get you there so fast! And Transportalate is probably an even better spell, especially on a large lot. She can get to that crying baby so fast! Faster than spacebending or the wellness transportation, I've timed it, transportalate is the fastest. Repario is another amazing spell for busy parents. 

My sim lives with her elderly mother,and together they raise her two children. Grandma only got interested when she found out her grandchildren both have the Ancient Bloodline trait, now she's got to see that they're raised right! A long time ago she made and drank a potion that prevents her from ever dying of old age.  So she can properly raise all the future generations, as long as they've got the trait that is. So spellcasting also gave me an immortal witch nanny.

What I wish I wouldve known when I started playing the sims 4,"Ive been playing for almost seven years and on this maybe two month long save Ive finally figured out how to get rich without cheats.

Plants.

My sims make approximately 35k(?) a day off of plants. Every morning my simself goes and sells all the produce before work. 
It started off with snapdragons because I realized how much I can make off those, then I as I leveled up how much more I could make.

Ive become a crazy plant lady in the sims but it makes so much money that I dont actually know what to do with it.

Id like to provide some more reasons why the plants help my sims in other ways as well,

1. Growfruit is a LIFE SAVER when it comes to fertilizing/leveling up your plants.

2. My vegetarian sim loves it. She can just go take some dragonfruit from her grandmas garden and doesnt have to cook (despite her grandma having a maxed out cooking skill) 

3. My sims are all very outdoorsy and its super beneficial to their plantsy aspirations/traits

4. Its aesthetically pleasing for me, I love the way plants look and oh my GOD I dont know what I wouldve done with my yard had I not gotten them.

5. It doesnt take up too much of my space. My sims are forever on the og streamlet single, just heavily upgraded, I like the lot, I like the space, its perfect for me.

6. My simself + fianc are vampire sims. The plasma fruit tree lets them make as many plasma Janes as they want so they dont have to mess with the townies

7. Since you dont have to use cheats, you can get all the achievements you want. Ive gotten so many off of this save.

Overall. Just get the plants, especially if youre an achievement hunter like me its the best way to do it without cheats. It took me maybe a week or two out of my save for them to get to where they are now.",0.99,1691,0,1691,1745083897.0,"{'neg': 0.004, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.224, 'compound': 0.9979}",Positive

"Its The Purge, so let me tell you about my unhinged Sims channel","Hi! Im @Sim_Rot. 

My life was falling apart, so I did what anyone does: threw myself into The Sims. I created a YT channel as a creative outlet to help ease my anxiety and put myself out there more. You may have seen my cozy Bob Ross series, but my other videos are a bit more chaotic. 

I was inspired by Whiny Brit, GrayStillPlays, and CallMeKevin, though I still have a lot to learn compared to those masters. But I like getting weird with the game and testing the limits of gameplay without mods. 

In one of my favorite videos, my sims tries to get rich using only a trash can. He ends up tearing the Landgraab family apart and making a cult dedicated to the base game Nano Can. 

In another life, he opens the worst tattoo ever where he only doles out awful face tattoos in an effort to brand every townie in the game. He completely ruins Nancy Landgraabs face. 

I also tackled the classic 1 Tile Box Challenge, but I tried to make it as difficult as possible by draining my sims needs my sims needs and giving him conflicting traits like active and outgoing. 

I also have a series where I put moldinitis from For Rent to the test. Do not watch if youre currently battling mold in your own home lol. 

I have a few more upcoming videos that involve another even more questionable business and an insane sugar daddy rags to riches challenge. If any of that sounds up your alley, feel free to give my channel a whirl. Ill link my channel in a comment below.

Whats the worst thing youve done to Judith Ward?,"I just got Get Famous, and immediately I realized for myself all the hype about Judith Ward being the worst lol. 

I made my first celeb Sim her best friend (may or may not have used cheats cause shes an ice queen.)

At this point she had a random baby, so I split and moved them out into Johnny Zests mobile home in Oasis Springs, dressed her WAY down (short brown hair, wrinkles, no makeup ever, all outfits brown and frumpy) did a celeb cleanse before taking her out of the spotlight and discontinuing her acting career before getting a job in retail. 

Then later I felt like ending her suffering and invited her over, added her to the household and made her jump into the shark pool until she died.

Best Pyjama Party ever... I guess,"Dear diary,

Then mom died because she forgot to stay out of the sun. But I talked to the scary guy and convinced him to revive her. So everything went great! I'm glad my friends were not traumatized from seeing my mom almost dying, and still loved my party. I would really suck to lose mom too, after dad died from a backfiring spell.

Idea: Neighborhood Stories for control freaks,"I've been playing with neighborhood stories completely off in a new save file because it scrambled the NPCs so badly in my legacy save. Even with the more unhinged options like horse adoption turned off, the randomness is just too much for me. Households will do wildly OOC things, like vampires moving to Sulani or whatever, and I hate it. You could come up with a storyline to explain stuff like that once in a while, but when ALL the households are making bizarre changes ALL the time, it's just too much.

But... I want there to be SOME story progression outside my household! Especially in a legacy where it doesn't make sense for the rest of the world to be basically frozen in place around them!

I'd love a version of Neighborhood Stories that allowed you to approve or cancel changes before they happen, like discovery traits/preferences. ""The Vatore family is thinking of moving to Sulani. Should they do it? [Yes/No]"" It could ofc queue up proposed changes in the mailbox ""check Neighborhood Stories"" option so you're not bombarded with popups about other households randomly during gameplay.

I think this would be a great option (in addition to the way it currently works, not completely replacing it) for control freaks like me who want story progression in unplayed households but basically want veto power over it. Like instead of turning off horse adoption completely, I'd love to be able to go case-by-case and approve it if it's a household living on a big farm in Henford-on-Bagley, and disapprove it if it's a household in a San Myshuno apartment.

I know MCCC has its own story progression features that predate Neighborhood Stories, but from what I've seen in its settings, ""approve or cancel changes before they happen"" is not an option in that either.

I wish new Sims didnt have to actually be brand new to life.,"I know Im far from the first person to point this out, but I hate how new Sims have no ability to have a backstory that is reflected in gameplay. I would love to be able to program Sims in CAS to reflect a past. Like when I make Elder Sims, I want them to retired from a successful career; and instead, I get unemployed sims whose greatest achievement is being an average high school student. Id also love to be able to record a divorce without actually having to get divorced in the game. Especially the older the Sim is, the more it makes sense that they would have had more past relationships and experiences. I do like that you can create dead Sims now, because I use this feature a lot to create widows and widowers in CAS. 

Since younger Sims are allowed to develop skills in gameplay, it feels like you should get a certain number of skill points to assign to adult sims in CAS. (Im pretty sure you were able to do this in Sims2.) Am I really supposed to believe that my young adult Sim whose greatest aspiration in life is to become a chef has never cooked before? She waited until she was 18 years old to make a grilled cheese sandwich? I realize you can easily cheat to increase skill points, but its somewhat tedious and I find that it sometimes randomly just doesnt work. Its annoying that my super fit, workout obsessed Sim who owns a gym franchise has to get mentoring from a teenage Sim to gain skill faster, because for whatever reason, the cheat code just doesnt work in his game. A gym mogul whos a level 3 in fitness? Embarrassing lol. 

One thing I always laugh at is when two married sims who have multiple children together woo hoo in my game for the first time and it gets recorded as their first time ever woohooing.

It would also be fun to encounter NPCs who are randomly assigned back stories, even if they had to keep it a little more simplified. A cheerful vampire Sim who wants to find a soulmate? Kind of boring. A cheerful vampire Sim who was an overachiever in high school and has been divorced three times is looking for a soulmate? Far more intriguing.

I wish they added fake skin for tattoos :( ALSO some teen related gameplay gripes,"I don't like how the way you practice is just giving temporary tattoos to real sims! I would've thought they'd have all kinds of fun names and descriptions for fake skin. A lot of fake tattoo practice skin companies in real life are like ""real authentic human skin "" or something. It could've been fun to have as a trashley vendor item too to confuse people who aren't going that route. Like someone tries to start a pottery business and they're like why tf is this ""person"" selling skin? It's the type of thing I think the sims thrives off of (like the meat wall from eco lifestyle) and also makes it more authentic to actual tattooing. 

ALSO i'm currently playing a teen sim who aspires to be a tattoo artist and it's making me mourn the missed opportunities for shady/diy tattooing and teen rebellion. The teens are treated essentially as adults for this feature which is very annoying. Yes they have the same body mesh as the adults, but they shouldn't just be treated the same. My sim was able to walk into the ea built tattoo parlor, give her teenage friend a tattoo while the owner watched, and come back the next day and get her own and not a single sim cared, not even her caregiver. Showed it off to her and everything and she loved it.. It would be cool if there was a LITTLE bit of in depth gameplay to getting a tattoo especially as a teen. Barring them from getting them except at shady businesses or maybe with a parental permission slip (forged or real), and at the very least a negative caregiver/adult reaction to a teen showing off their tattoos or a teen with a new tattoos (or at least gotten without permission). 

In keeping with the teen tattoo artist I do wish there could be a more diy feel to it. Like if the tattoo gun was a separate inventory item and your sim could just give tattoos on any bed or couch or maybe even chair. The tattoo bed thingy is very nice for a Real Professional Tattoo Parlour, but what about my teenage sim who bought the tattoo gun online and is giving them to their friends in their bedroom? It could also have a higher chance of failure or something if you don't do it on the real tattoo bed. I also wish sims felt pain from getting a tattoo and had a chance at squirming and messing things up as the person getting the tattoo, maybe increased with certain attributes (teen, squeamish, etc.)

I also wish we got stick n pokes but that's probably too much to ask lol

Get to my greenhouse and adoption dude has the deepest voice I have -ever- heard from a randomized sim. He goes crazy so sure, I sign an autograph and queue up actions to play with the puppy who is still standing in this pile of sh\*t, poor thing.

Next thing I know, adoption evaluator strips all his clothes off right in front of me and goes outside to play in the rain! Okay weirdo, I just want this dog... I give the dog a treat, and he starts walking away from me. I queue up 'offer friendship' and 'adopt' actions but my sim doesn't move and the puppy is getting further away. Suddenly he disappears and my actions get canceled! The evaluator is still there, reading a book in my house in his skivvies. I can't adopt pupper from him so I search all over the farm for this tiny dog with no luck. Next thing I know I get 'evaluation over'.

I'm pretty sure this weirdo fan just set it all up to meet with his favorite celeb in hopes he got lucky.",0.99,427,0,427,1739317802.0,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.982}",Positive
My sim married Emit Relevart...,"I have a save file just for building and I normally create a random sim to test things out. 

With this new event, I switched from my male builder to a female. 

My gal, Danielle Hart now has a son with Emit and they've also eloped (I hate planning the wedding).  I don't want to move him in the household for fear it might somehow mess with the event.  So I've labelled this file The Time Traveller's Wife.  If after the event, Emit is gone, then at least she will have some happy memories.  If he remains in game, then I'll move him in. 

I wonder if moving him into the household will cause the game to create another Emit, just like it does with Grim.  Does anyone have any thoughts? 


- UPDATE: 
I never moved Emit into my household for fear it might mess up the event. However, I completed the event yesterday.  Just before I selected, ""Tell Emit Goodbye"", I added him to my family. I wasn't prepared for what happened next and I'm very glad I did that or my sim would've lost her husband.

When she told him goodbye, the game essentially erased him.   Though he was there physically, he had no name tag, just a blank one.  When I took him to CAS, I had to give him back his name, since he was now labelled sim 1. I also noticed that I could not change the colour of the facial hair I gave him, even though I unchecked the box which made it the same as his hair colour. I gave him a beard because he just looked too plain and uninteresting without his blue glasses.  In addition to that, I had re-dress him in his blue traveller outfit as the 3rd daily outfit since the game didn't copy the outfit over automatically.  I didn't want it as his main now he was a civilian.  

All in all this was pretty interesting and I'm so thankful that my sim got to keep her husband who incidentally has the trait  ""Child of the Islands"".  Hmmmmm some Sulani mermaid magic maybe? ",0.95,28,0,28,1739452952.0,"{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.5399}",Positive

"Sims 4 is good, EA can suck my non existent b@lls tho.","Don't get me wrong I love the sims 4 and I've played it since it came out in 2014. I hate to say it but I've spent over $1000 on it and though it shows how invested I am in the game, it is also one of the worst parts of it.

Frankly I'm tired of EA. Not the sims, just EA. EA has made it clear that they don't actually care about the sims or its players. Because they know people are going to buy packs regardless of quality or the price, they cut corners and push out half assed excuses for packs. Not to mention there is no other game on the planet where people are willing to spend over $1000 on it in order to have a full experience and think that is completely acceptable.

At first it was fine. Outdoor Retreat and Get Together were them dipping their toes into the DLC waters to test how they could improve players experiences and still make a buck. There was thought and effort put into it even if the content itself (specifically CAS) isn't as polished as what we can expect from packs we get today. But tbh seeing a major difference in hair models and clothes after a decade should be expected. There was plenty of time between packs being released that allowed time for the packs to be fully developed and bugs and cross-compatibily to be ironed out before releasing something new. The gaps between packs also got people more excited to buy them and experience it. Now, it seems like there is a new pack every month. Now when I see an ad or trailer for a new pack I think 3 things:

1. ""Okay cool. Another one of EAs attempts to suck my wallet dry and not give us what players have been begging for for years""
2. "" If I were to buy this, I wonder how buggy and broken everything will be even if I don't load my mods.""
3. "" And how long after I start playing with this pack will I find that it's more of the same thing, rabbit holes and disappointment. Will it have me, like every time for a while, quiting the game and not picking it up for 5 months?""

I hate that they refuse to put in the time to accually make the game playable before trying to shove more packs in our faces. At some point the game will become so unplayable that the moment you try to open the game after downloading a pack it will just straight up crash immediately. Their so preoccupied with making more money through packs that they neglect the quality of the base game and fixing the packs that already exist.

There are so many DLCs for the sims 4 that I literally can't count them off the top of my head anymore, if I had to guess it would be somewhere between 100 and 150 DLCs (expansion packs, game packs, stuff packs, and kits combined), but I wouldn't be surprised if there were more. Name me a another game with that many DLCs. You can't because it's the only one and EA gets away with it because they know we'll continue to consume. It's why I think we haven't gotten a Sims 5 yet (or never will) because from a business perspective, why would you give up on your cash cow when you can still milk it, right?

 EA is great for other games and doesn't even try to pull the same stunts on those players because they know it wouldn't work. They put massive amounts of effort into other games like 'Unraveled' and 'It Takes Two' because games like them aren't ones you can make 4000 DLCs for and pulling the things they do with the sims wouldn't fly with those games' players. Imagine Unraveled but you had to pay $20 for yarn graphics. Imagine It Takes Two but needing to pay $40 to play with anouther person. It's that low key disrespect towards sims players that makes me so mad. You would think EA would respect and listen to the players of their most successful franchise. You would think a game company would do everything they can to ensure that their players play games that give them a complete experience without paying a fortune for it. You would hope that there would be some level of quality control that made a game playable without relying on the community of modders fix bugs and issues. But I guess disappointment is just something I should expect from EA when it comes to the sims.

The sims 4 has been a game that I always come back to eventually. It's like a best friend you can go months without talking to and pick up right where you left off when you talk again. I enjoy making sims, giving Townes makeovers, building houses, furnishing apartments, watching my sims grow from babies to elders and guiding them through their lives. I know that the sims is something I will never fully get sick of. However, EA just puts a bad taste in my mouth. It makes the game less enjoyable when you know that the company who makes and distributes it will only ever see you as a source of income and nothing more. It hurts a little to know that they won't ever really listen to what you have to say when you tell them how they can improve the game or ideas for DLCs and when they do listen it's only after years of begging.

To be completely clear im not says that love and care isn't put into the game or its DLCs. The people who do the accual work of making animations, codes, ect for the packs and work to fix issues aren't who I'm disappointed in. They work hard and I appreciate them for their efforts. They do what they can with the time and resources they are given. It's the company itself I don't like which makes me have a very love hate relationship with the sims 4. A relationship that I wish was all love.

I can't be the only one fed up with EA acting like real life Landgrabbs, right?

"Storyline Ideas  that have kept things interesting, especially in my legacy files!","1. With the new skill mentoring options, every single teen / young adult / adult / elder comes over after school if my sim is working or building their skills so a cousin, auntie, or grandma can give an after-school violin or piano or logic lesson. The schedule changes whether or not theyre involved in after-school activities, &amp; the lesson will be over by dinner but it is so good for building relationships &amp; skills simultaneously 

2. Especially after they introduced horses, i always have a farm within the family with horses for any kids growing up in the suburbs to take lessons. Whether the equestrian lessons are after school for a few days or they just move in with Grandma for the summer, its great for them to eventually compete &amp; win without having to have the horses live on their property, &amp; its cute to take the trophies back to their room after the summer. Its like the movie Flicka where the mom chose a different life but the kids still go back to the farm 

3. Although its annoying, try to utilize holidays as much as possible, ESPECIALLY SUMMER / WINTER / FALL BREAKS. You dont even have to do traditions, you can just check off that theres no school or work. Its relieving to have vacation time without needing to take the vacation

4. With as many skilled sims as possible, try to challenge yourself to fill the gaps in each career, especially the doctor career. When your sim arrives at the hospital in labor, &amp; you have family members that are at different levels (i.e. nurse, receptionist, medical tech, doctor, surgeon, chief of staff) they may be staffed at the hospital when you have the baby. Also, the labor mod really gives you an immersive at-home option where having a doctor in the family makes it a special moment

5. Make a rescue vet clinic with low prices to compete with an upscale vet clinic, that way if down the line your sim needs to save money they have options

6. BB.ENABLEFREEBUILD
Make sure you get functional gallery replacements for the hospital, police station, etc but especially the high school. I personally revamped my gallery edit &amp; found the perfect way to utilize essentially every skill. Now, the high school has:
Basketball court inside w bleachers &amp; soccer field outside, outdoor food stalls with city recipe kiosks &amp; picnic areas, a full yoga room next to a separate full-sized cheer room, a big gym that everyone can use in the morning or EOD, a separate boy / girl lounge with coffee, entertainment etc &amp; photo booths, arcade games &amp; karaoke machine outside of the gym &amp; yoga area, a coffee / computer cafe separate from the lunchroom, a full debate stage with chairs for the audience, a police station for the sneaky lick trends, separate boy &amp; girl locker rooms with showers, art, science, computer labs separate from the classrooms that lessons take place, as well as separate admin offices like athletics, guidance counselors, &amp; the main office w the principal.

7. Separate Boy / Girl Uniforms for school everyday outfits to insinuate your toddlers are in montessori, &amp; kids &amp; teens are in private school, if you have different grades they can have different corresponding uniforms especially for specific colors (there are many cc creators that make private school uniforms)

8. In order to have a successful save, try to keep the generations alive to keep elders busy. Invite them over for stay overs to raise the kids non-stop, the growing together pack really changed elders

9. to differentiate age groups, have your oldest elders live in a retirement home (for rent needed) &amp; give them clubs (get together) with activities like knitting or walking around San sequoia (growing together). Have them be differentiated from your younger elders that live in the suburbs by giving them more wrinkles or glasses or head scarves, &amp; shorter thinner whiter hair

10. Open a RETAIL STORE w one of your fresh chef sims &amp; make all of the city recipes so any of your sims can buy them &amp; learn them on the spot. If you have dine out, you can do this with the experimental dishes as well, you just need the chefs station from that pack to make them after you learn the recipe from ordering it at an experimental restaurant. Especially if you have a legacy save, its great to have sims you no longer use take over retail stores like this to keep it in business &amp; not lose all of the recipes over &amp; over again

11. A huge part of my legacy file has been ingratiating my innocent lineage with mafia figures in the criminal career &amp; having the children of these resulting marriages either marry rival mafia figures &amp; start their own lineage, or leave the life altogether &amp; stop talking to the family members that are still connected. Its interesting thru the years to see, for example, in 3 generations to see a successful criminal have multiple kids, the son inherits the business &amp; gets help from his parents to raise the next mafia figures, while the daughter leaves altogether for a simpler life in the countryside &amp; subsequently receives 0 support or visits from her criminally-connected family members, even during the worst financial constraints. Having different cousins &amp; uncles in politics, law &amp; order, law enforcement, etc makes things extra interesting when everyone is aligning each others pockets

12. Have struggling young families run small businesses like flower shops, wedding dress stores, or just utilize the idea of a walkable commercial space especially office buildings. Have a business park campus for important meetings or club gatherings

13. Make clubs for group gatherings like PTA moms, single dads, cheer squad (cheer practice can be everyday after school w that option) &amp; make complicated social dynamic rules for each club, even if its a homeless group of teens that eats at bars &amp; showers in gyms, the possibilities are endless

Good ways to k*ll off a sim I don't want?,"So basically I never like my founder's son Steve's wife, and I can feel I just get more and more bored with her. So how can I kill her off the funniest way?

So I read somewhere that she could die from overheating in the sauna (with the door locked or just ""gone"" xD), and BOOM after barely 5 minutes IRL (on higher speed) she was dead as a caught fish!

Is it possible to take the home (the dwelling) of another (not mine) Sim?

My celebrity zoo has descended into chaos,"EA gave me Businesses and Hobbies, and naturally, I built a celebrity zoo. Because a real zoo would be unethical. 

After welcoming all my residents, things quickly descended into chaos. The general public loves to watch Captain Mack Swallow consume copious amounts of juice. And after Nina Caliente accidentally got stuck in Dirk Dreamers cell, excuse me I mean apartment, she and Dirk hit it off and even had their first kiss! 

But its hard to find good help. Even Berts evil apprentice Malcolm Landgraab sleeps on the job. And then he died. Unceremoniously at that. 

Right after Malcolm died, another employee quit. And then we got robbed. To add insult to injury, it wasnt even Robin Banks. 

I decided to spice things up and connect all the living quarters to an underground recreational dungeon. Turns out it was the perfect place for employees to sneak naps. But our guests enjoyed mingling amongst themselves. Judith Ward even showed Bob Ross and Stuart Little her favorite recipe: microwaved smelly plate air. 

But then the worst thing happened. Bob Ross heard Reddits cries and somehow broke out. He evaporated into the ether, only to reappear and take out the trash. It was bizarre. But it proves hes happy at R U Not Entertainedment! Though there was another scare where I thought his painting was a cry for help. Turns out it was just a recreation of an alien abduction. See, hes totally fine!! 

And as an act of kindness, Bert hired Geoffrey Landgraab. Geoffrey would hangout and clean up the place after Malcolms death, so he might as well get (fake) payment for it. 

Of course I documented this all on my channel. Ill link below if you want to give the chaos a whirl &lt;3

"Interior Decorator was a good idea, executed by a mad-man who hates the world.","Okay, on the surface, the Interior Decorator job is really cool.

You take gigs to go visit people's houses and businesses.  You interview them, see what they like, and get to play build mode for fun and profit.  Sounds good, right?

Sweet Sim Jeebus, no, it isn't.

If you don't find your gig employer before the gig starts and manually set their likes to be decent, the game assigns RANDOM likes to them.  So next thing you know, you're talking to the client about redoing their bar, and they're telling you ""You will fail this gig and everyone will hate you if you don't decorate in hot pink and neon green, and it all has to be in the theme of patio furniture.""

Now, I'm not going to say the Sims team puts in a ton of effort to make the best default builds anyone has ever seen, but holy crap are even the WORST dev builds better than 90% of what the Interior Decorator requirements force you to make for people.

Spellcasters make the best parents ,"Transportalate and scruberoo make raising kids a breeze. My sim's baby just had a blowout all over her, usually a nightmare as they freak out about being dirty, refusing to clean up the poor baby. She just scrubaroo'd herself and she's happy as a clam! I did just learn she can't scruberoo the baby tho. But it's also amazing for toddlers, she has finished the entire skill tree, so she can cast a spell from across their huge house to clean a potty chair before he gets to it. Messy eater quirk? Np, SCRUBEROO! And if your spellcaster isn't leveled up, those kids will get you there so fast! And Transportalate is probably an even better spell, especially on a large lot. She can get to that crying baby so fast! Faster than spacebending or the wellness transportation, I've timed it, transportalate is the fastest. Repario is another amazing spell for busy parents. 

My sim lives with her elderly mother,and together they raise her two children. Grandma only got interested when she found out her grandchildren both have the Ancient Bloodline trait, now she's got to see that they're raised right! A long time ago she made and drank a potion that prevents her from ever dying of old age.  So she can properly raise all the future generations, as long as they've got the trait that is. So spellcasting also gave me an immortal witch nanny.

Tldr: spellcasters are the best parents, and the best occult

I was terrified of it for a long time, but I finally bought it on the last sale and. Its fine? 

The romantic satisfaction system decays quickly, yes. But my 5th gen couple was compatible and never dipped below fine. All I had to do to keep them at satisfied or very satisfied was flirt a few times once a day. They dont even need to woo-hoo. 

I can see how this is annoying for people who like to set it and forget it but I actually like enjoy having to work to maintain the relationship now. 

Hell, Im actively trying to get my 6th Gen heirs wife to break up with him for the drama, and theyre both very satisfied even though she finds him unattractive. 

Custom dates change my gameplay for the better. I also really love all the new romantic interactions, and the CAS and BB items.

I'm not really a family player but i always play with more than one sim in the same household.

I still have a background story in my mind for them, where they're from and where they're going. I try to make their relationships unique and meaningful. I like having lots of activities i can make them indulge in. I enjoy trying to max skills and careers that i see fit for each of my sims and trying to get good grades in uni when i want an overachiever. I'm a huge fan of occults as well, ever since i got occult packs my sims tend to belong to one and i love creating club hangouts for occult sims, also using mods to expand the occult experience. The animals i have from packs are now from cottage living i like the farm animals but i love the wild foxes and rabbits and the birds, i also have dolphins from island living but didn't play around with them yet.

What I wish I wouldve known when I started playing the sims 4,"Ive been playing for almost seven years and on this maybe two month long save Ive finally figured out how to get rich without cheats.

Plants.

My sims make approximately 35k(?) a day off of plants. Every morning my simself goes and sells all the produce before work. 
It started off with snapdragons because I realized how much I can make off those, then I as I leveled up how much more I could make.

Ive become a crazy plant lady in the sims but it makes so much money that I dont actually know what to do with it.

Id like to provide some more reasons why the plants help my sims in other ways as well,

1. Growfruit is a LIFE SAVER when it comes to fertilizing/leveling up your plants.

2. My vegetarian sim loves it. She can just go take some dragonfruit from her grandmas garden and doesnt have to cook (despite her grandma having a maxed out cooking skill) 

3. My sims are all very outdoorsy and its super beneficial to their plantsy aspirations/traits

4. Its aesthetically pleasing for me, I love the way plants look and oh my GOD I dont know what I wouldve done with my yard had I not gotten them.

5. It doesnt take up too much of my space. My sims are forever on the og streamlet single, just heavily upgraded, I like the lot, I like the space, its perfect for me.

6. My simself + fianc are vampire sims. The plasma fruit tree lets them make as many plasma Janes as they want so they dont have to mess with the townies

7. Since you dont have to use cheats, you can get all the achievements you want. Ive gotten so many off of this save.

Overall. Just get the plants, especially if youre an achievement hunter like me its the best way to do it without cheats. It took me maybe a week or two out of my save for them to get to where they are now.",0.99,1689,0,1689,1745083897.0,"{'neg': 0.004, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.224, 'compound': 0.9979}",Positive

"Its The Purge, so let me tell you about my unhinged Sims channel","Hi! Im @Sim_Rot. 

My life was falling apart, so I did what anyone does: threw myself into The Sims. I created a YT channel as a creative outlet to help ease my anxiety and put myself out there more. You may have seen my cozy Bob Ross series, but my other videos are a bit more chaotic. 

I was inspired by Whiny Brit, GrayStillPlays, and CallMeKevin, though I still have a lot to learn compared to those masters. But I like getting weird with the game and testing the limits of gameplay without mods. 

In one of my favorite videos, my sims tries to get rich using only a trash can. He ends up tearing the Landgraab family apart and making a cult dedicated to the base game Nano Can. 

In another life, he opens the worst tattoo ever where he only doles out awful face tattoos in an effort to brand every townie in the game. He completely ruins Nancy Landgraabs face. 

I also tackled the classic 1 Tile Box Challenge, but I tried to make it as difficult as possible by draining my sims needs my sims needs and giving him conflicting traits like active and outgoing. 

I also have a series where I put moldinitis from For Rent to the test. Do not watch if youre currently battling mold in your own home lol. 

I have a few more upcoming videos that involve another even more questionable business and an insane sugar daddy rags to riches challenge. If any of that sounds up your alley, feel free to give my channel a whirl. Ill link my channel in a comment below.

Idea: Neighborhood Stories for control freaks,"I've been playing with neighborhood stories completely off in a new save file because it scrambled the NPCs so badly in my legacy save. Even with the more unhinged options like horse adoption turned off, the randomness is just too much for me. Households will do wildly OOC things, like vampires moving to Sulani or whatever, and I hate it. You could come up with a storyline to explain stuff like that once in a while, but when ALL the households are making bizarre changes ALL the time, it's just too much.

But... I want there to be SOME story progression outside my household! Especially in a legacy where it doesn't make sense for the rest of the world to be basically frozen in place around them!

I'd love a version of Neighborhood Stories that allowed you to approve or cancel changes before they happen, like discovery traits/preferences. ""The Vatore family is thinking of moving to Sulani. Should they do it? [Yes/No]"" It could ofc queue up proposed changes in the mailbox ""check Neighborhood Stories"" option so you're not bombarded with popups about other households randomly during gameplay.

I think this would be a great option (in addition to the way it currently works, not completely replacing it) for control freaks like me who want story progression in unplayed households but basically want veto power over it. Like instead of turning off horse adoption completely, I'd love to be able to go case-by-case and approve it if it's a household living on a big farm in Henford-on-Bagley, and disapprove it if it's a household in a San Myshuno apartment.

I know MCCC has its own story progression features that predate Neighborhood Stories, but from what I've seen in its settings, ""approve or cancel changes before they happen"" is not an option in that either.

Does anyone ever regret getting the Seasons pack?,"I know its a big favorite for Sims YouTubers, but I wonder how many people regret getting the pack. 

Sure it adds realism, but sometimes Ill have a quasi-Stardew save file, and you know what irks me about Stardew to the point I sometimes cheat to avoid it for as long as possible? Seasons.

I wish new Sims didnt have to actually be brand new to life.,"I know Im far from the first person to point this out, but I hate how new Sims have no ability to have a backstory that is reflected in gameplay. I would love to be able to program Sims in CAS to reflect a past. Like when I make Elder Sims, I want them to retired from a successful career; and instead, I get unemployed sims whose greatest achievement is being an average high school student. Id also love to be able to record a divorce without actually having to get divorced in the game. Especially the older the Sim is, the more it makes sense that they would have had more past relationships and experiences. I do like that you can create dead Sims now, because I use this feature a lot to create widows and widowers in CAS. 

Since younger Sims are allowed to develop skills in gameplay, it feels like you should get a certain number of skill points to assign to adult sims in CAS. (Im pretty sure you were able to do this in Sims2.) Am I really supposed to believe that my young adult Sim whose greatest aspiration in life is to become a chef has never cooked before? She waited until she was 18 years old to make a grilled cheese sandwich? I realize you can easily cheat to increase skill points, but its somewhat tedious and I find that it sometimes randomly just doesnt work. Its annoying that my super fit, workout obsessed Sim who owns a gym franchise has to get mentoring from a teenage Sim to gain skill faster, because for whatever reason, the cheat code just doesnt work in his game. A gym mogul whos a level 3 in fitness? Embarrassing lol. 

One thing I always laugh at is when two married sims who have multiple children together woo hoo in my game for the first time and it gets recorded as their first time ever woohooing.

It would also be fun to encounter NPCs who are randomly assigned back stories, even if they had to keep it a little more simplified. A cheerful vampire Sim who wants to find a soulmate? Kind of boring. A cheerful vampire Sim who was an overachiever in high school and has been divorced three times is looking for a soulmate? Far more intriguing.

I wish they added fake skin for tattoos :( ALSO some teen related gameplay gripes,"I don't like how the way you practice is just giving temporary tattoos to real sims! I would've thought they'd have all kinds of fun names and descriptions for fake skin. A lot of fake tattoo practice skin companies in real life are like ""real authentic human skin "" or something. It could've been fun to have as a trashley vendor item too to confuse people who aren't going that route. Like someone tries to start a pottery business and they're like why tf is this ""person"" selling skin? It's the type of thing I think the sims thrives off of (like the meat wall from eco lifestyle) and also makes it more authentic to actual tattooing. 

ALSO i'm currently playing a teen sim who aspires to be a tattoo artist and it's making me mourn the missed opportunities for shady/diy tattooing and teen rebellion. The teens are treated essentially as adults for this feature which is very annoying. Yes they have the same body mesh as the adults, but they shouldn't just be treated the same. My sim was able to walk into the ea built tattoo parlor, give her teenage friend a tattoo while the owner watched, and come back the next day and get her own and not a single sim cared, not even her caregiver. Showed it off to her and everything and she loved it.. It would be cool if there was a LITTLE bit of in depth gameplay to getting a tattoo especially as a teen. Barring them from getting them except at shady businesses or maybe with a parental permission slip (forged or real), and at the very least a negative caregiver/adult reaction to a teen showing off their tattoos or a teen with a new tattoos (or at least gotten without permission). 

In keeping with the teen tattoo artist I do wish there could be a more diy feel to it. Like if the tattoo gun was a separate inventory item and your sim could just give tattoos on any bed or couch or maybe even chair. The tattoo bed thingy is very nice for a Real Professional Tattoo Parlour, but what about my teenage sim who bought the tattoo gun online and is giving them to their friends in their bedroom? It could also have a higher chance of failure or something if you don't do it on the real tattoo bed. I also wish sims felt pain from getting a tattoo and had a chance at squirming and messing things up as the person getting the tattoo, maybe increased with certain attributes (teen, squeamish, etc.)

I also wish we got stick n pokes but that's probably too much to ask lol

AITA for not wanting anything to do with my dad after he broke up a marriage and creeped on my wife?,"I, young adult M, was raised by my mother and live with my uncle's family (dad's twin brother). He was never around as I was a kid or in my teens and I rarely even saw him at big family events. As an adult, I told my wife Morgan that I wanted to try and have a relationship with him when we found out we were expecting our first set of twins. And this was my first mistake I believe. 

After a few months of speaking with him, I started noticing he would act strange when I brought up my wife... Then I caught him in the act of peeping in our windows of our house. I was unsure what he had seen of her or what he hadn't but I knew I had to put a stop to it. And then for a while everything seemed normal. 

Then, today, I was going to head to San Myshuno for a bit of a different seen from my house and the area of San Sequioa. I thought why not invite him? After all he is my dad and I would like one good memory of him. 

When he replied it was of him asking if his wife and step kids could come to. Im sat there dumbfound like, step kids? You couldn't even be bothered with your only kid?!

I told him no, and I also told him that if he didn't want to be a part of my life and never wanted to raise me or anything until it benefited him, then I wanted nothing to do with him. I also told him he wasnt allowed to see his grandkids anymore, which sure is harsh but he wants something to do with everyone but me, and Im tired of it. 

And thats not even the worst part of the new wife thing. I found out he broke up Mortimer and Bella Goth somehow and now is married to Bella?! Im so confused on how he managed that because frankly, the man has awful hygiene and is nothing compared to Mortimer. 

Also, maybe this is all my fault? I knew he was a bad parent previously and he always was shown to me as a bad person. I mean I grew up on my uncle's show horse farm and my dad sold all my grandmother's horses instead of telling my uncle to get them. So it very well could just be I was too nave to realize he wouldn't change.

My sim married Emit Relevart...,"I have a save file just for building and I normally create a random sim to test things out. 

With this new event, I switched from my male builder to a female. 

My gal, Danielle Hart now has a son with Emit and they've also eloped (I hate planning the wedding).  I don't want to move him in the household for fear it might somehow mess with the event.  So I've labelled this file The Time Traveller's Wife.  If after the event, Emit is gone, then at least she will have some happy memories.  If he remains in game, then I'll move him in. 

I wonder if moving him into the household will cause the game to create another Emit, just like it does with Grim.  Does anyone have any thoughts? 


- UPDATE: 
I never moved Emit into my household for fear it might mess up the event. However, I completed the event yesterday.  Just before I selected, ""Tell Emit Goodbye"", I added him to my family. I wasn't prepared for what happened next and I'm very glad I did that or my sim would've lost her husband.

When she told him goodbye, the game essentially erased him.   Though he was there physically, he had no name tag, just a blank one.  When I took him to CAS, I had to give him back his name, since he was now labelled sim 1. I also noticed that I could not change the colour of the facial hair I gave him, even though I unchecked the box which made it the same as his hair colour. I gave him a beard because he just looked too plain and uninteresting without his blue glasses.  In addition to that, I had re-dress him in his blue traveller outfit as the 3rd daily outfit since the game didn't copy the outfit over automatically.  I didn't want it as his main now he was a civilian.

Worst. Adoption Evaluation. Evar.,"Oh sims. I love the stories we get sometimes.

Get to my greenhouse and adoption dude has the deepest voice I have -ever- heard from a randomized sim. He goes crazy so sure, I sign an autograph and queue up actions to play with the puppy who is still standing in this pile of sh\*t, poor thing.

Next thing I know, adoption evaluator strips all his clothes off right in front of me and goes outside to play in the rain! Okay weirdo, I just want this dog... I give the dog a treat, and he starts walking away from me. I queue up 'offer friendship' and 'adopt' actions but my sim doesn't move and the puppy is getting further away. Suddenly he disappears and my actions get canceled! The evaluator is still there, reading a book in my house in his skivvies.
